## Release Notes.

### 0.0.11
° Add `timestamp` via [`getTime()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location.html#getTime()) to the `location` object. Returns the UNIX timestamp (in millis) of when the location was generated.

### 0.0.8
° Added `forceNewLocation` as an optional argument to `getFusedLocation`. This gets a new location everytime and never reuses a last known location.

° Added a check if GPS Provider or Network Provider exists on the device. Useful on emulators where `getFusedLocation` used to hang when GPS was turned off.

° Added `mocked` property to the `Location` object.
