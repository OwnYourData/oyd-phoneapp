------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background Fetch is a *very* simple plugin which will awaken an app in the background about **every 15 minutes**, providing a short period of background running-time.  This plugin will execute your provided `callbackFn` whenever a background-fetch event occurs.  

There is **no way** to increase the rate which a fetch-event occurs and this plugin sets the rate to the most frequent possible &mdash; you will **never** receive an event faster than **15 minutes**.  The operating-system will automatically throttle the rate the background-fetch events occur based upon usage patterns.  Eg: if user hasn't turned on their phone for a long period of time, fetch events will occur less frequently.

The Android plugin provides a [HeadlessJS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/headless-js-android.html) implementation allowing you to continue handling events even after app-termination (see **[`@config enableHeadless`](#config-boolean-enableheadless-false)**)

## Installing the plugin ##

```Bash
$ npm install react-native-background-fetch --save
```

### :information_source: Solving Android Gradle Conflicts.

Once of the most common build-issues with Android apps are gradle conflicts between modules specifying different versions of:
- `compileSdkVersion`
- `buildToolsVersion`
- Google `play-services` / `firebase` version.
- Google support libraries (ie `appcompat-v4`, `appcompat-v7`)

For more information, see the Wiki [Solving Android Gradle Conflicts](../../wiki/Solving-Android-Gradle-Conflicts)

## Config

### Common Options

#### `@param {Integer} minimumFetchInterval [15]`

The minimum interval in **minutes** to execute background fetch events.  Defaults to **`15`** minutes.  **Note**:  Background-fetch events will **never** occur at a frequency higher than **every 15 minutes**.  Apple uses a secret algorithm to adjust the frequency of fetch events, presumably based upon usage patterns of the app.  Fetch events *can* occur less often than your configured `minimumFetchInterval`.

### Android Options

#### `@config {Boolean} stopOnTerminate [true]`

Set `false` to continue background-fetch events after user terminates the app.  Default to `true`.

#### `@config {Boolean} startOnBoot [false]`

Set `true` to initiate background-fetch events when the device is rebooted.  Defaults to `false`.

:exclamation: **NOTE:** `startOnBoot` requires `stopOnTerminate: false`.

#### `@config {Boolean} forceReload [false]`

Set `true` to automatically relaunch the application (if it was terminated) &mdash; the application will launch to the foreground then immediately minimize.  Defaults to `false`.

#### `@config {Boolean} enableHeadless [false]`

Set `true` to enable React Native's [Headless JS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/headless-js-android.html) mechanism, for handling fetch events after app termination.

```javascript
import BackgroundFetch from "react-native-background-fetch";

let MyHeadlessTask = async (event) => {
  console.log('- BackgroundFetch HeadlessTask start');
  // Important:  await asychronous tasks when using HeadlessJS.
  await doAction();
  // Required:  Signal to native code that your task is complete.
  // If you don't do this, your app could be terminated and/or assigned
  // battery-blame for consuming too much time in background.
  BackgroundFetch.finish(BackgroundFetch.FETCH_RESULT_NEW_DATA);
  console.log('- BackgroundFetch HeadlessTask finished');
}

// Simulate a long-running task (eg: HTTP request)
function doAction() {
  let timeout = 5000;
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('*** TIMEOUT ***');
      resolve();
    }, timeout);
  });
}

// Register your BackgroundFetch HeadlessTask
AppRegistry.registerHeadlessTask('BackgroundFetch', () => MyHeadlessTask);
```


## Methods

| Method Name | Arguments | Notes
|---|---|---|
| `configure` | `{config}`, `callbackFn`, `failureFn` | Configures the plugin's fetch `callbackFn`.  This callback will fire each time an iOS background-fetch event occurs (typically every 15 min).  The `failureFn` will be called if the device doesn't support background-fetch. |
| `status` | `callbackFn` | Your callback will be executed with the current `status (Integer)` `0: Restricted`, `1: Denied`, `2: Available`.  These constants are defined as `BackgroundFetch.STATUS_RESTRICTED`, `BackgroundFetch.STATUS_DENIED`, `BackgroundFetch.STATUS_AVAILABLE` (**NOTE:** Android will always return `STATUS_AVAILABLE`)|
| `finish` | `fetchResult` | Valid values for `fetchResult (Integer)` include `BackgroundFetch.FETCH_RESULT_NEW_DATA` (0), `BackgroundFetch.FETCH_RESULT_NO_DATA` (1), and `BackgroundFetch.FETCH_RESULT_FAILED` (2).  You **MUST** call this method in your fetch `callbackFn` provided to `#configure` in order to signal to iOS that your fetch action is complete.  iOS provides **only** 30s of background-time for a fetch-event -- if you exceed this 30s, iOS will kill your app. |
| `start` | `successFn`, `failureFn` | Start the background-fetch API.  Your `callbackFn` provided to `#configure` will be executed each time a background-fetch event occurs.  **NOTE** the `#configure` method *automatically* calls `#start`.  You do **not** have to call this method after you `#configure` the plugin |
| `stop` | `successFn`, `failureFn` | Stop the background-fetch API from firing fetch events.  Your `callbackFn` provided to `#configure` will no longer be executed. |

## Example ##

```javascript

import BackgroundFetch from "react-native-background-fetch";

export default class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Configure it.
    BackgroundFetch.configure({
      minimumFetchInterval: 15, // <-- minutes (15 is minimum allowed)
      stopOnTerminate: false,   // <-- Android-only,
      startOnBoot: true         // <-- Android-only
    }, () => {
      console.log("[js] Received background-fetch event");
      // Required: Signal completion of your task to native code
      // If you fail to do this, the OS can terminate your app
      // or assign battery-blame for consuming too much background-time
      BackgroundFetch.finish(BackgroundFetch.FETCH_RESULT_NEW_DATA);
    }, (error) => {
      console.log("[js] RNBackgroundFetch failed to start");
    });

    // Optional: Query the authorization status.
    BackgroundFetch.status((status) => {
      switch(status) {
        case BackgroundFetch.STATUS_RESTRICTED:
          console.log("BackgroundFetch restricted");
          break;
        case BackgroundFetch.STATUS_DENIED:
          console.log("BackgroundFetch denied");
          break;
        case BackgroundFetch.STATUS_AVAILABLE:
          console.log("BackgroundFetch is enabled");
          break;
      }
    });
  }
};
```

## Debugging

### iOS

- Simulate background fetch events in XCode using **`Debug->Simulate Background Fetch`**
- iOS can take some hours or even days to start a consistently scheduling background-fetch events since iOS schedules fetch events based upon the user's patterns of activity.  If *Simulate Background Fetch* works, your can be **sure** that everything is working fine.  You just need to wait.

### Android

- Observe plugin logs in `$ adb logcat`:
```bash
$ adb logcat *:S ReactNative:V ReactNativeJS:V TSBackgroundFetch:V
```
- Simulate a background-fetch event on a device (insert *&lt;your.application.id&gt;*) (only works for sdk `21+`:
```bash
$ adb shell cmd jobscheduler run -f <your.application.id> 999
```
- For devices with sdk `<21`, simulate a "Headless JS" event with (insert *&lt;your.application.id&gt;*)
```bash
$ adb shell am broadcast -a <your.application.id>.event.BACKGROUND_FETCH

```

## Implementation

### iOS

Implements [performFetchWithCompletionHandler](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:), firing a custom event subscribed-to in cordova plugin.

### Android

Android implements background fetch using two different mechanisms, depending on the Android SDK version.  Where the SDK version is `>= LOLLIPOP`, the new [`JobScheduler`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobScheduler.html) API is used.  Otherwise, the old [`AlarmManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html) will be used.

Unlike iOS, the Android implementation *can* continue to operate after application terminate (`stopOnTerminate: false`) or device reboot (`startOnBoot: true`).
